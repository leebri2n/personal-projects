Welcome!

This repository contains various projects I made beyond the classroom. As a student who was once quite new to computer programming and the field of data analytics, I developed these projects out of personal interest and a desire to further my skills. As one will quickly notice, some of these are rudimentary Python scripts as I tried to teach myself Python, which do basic tasks. Capabilities of these programs grow as my interests grew, and I hope that is visible.

Thank you for your time.
