Welcome!

My name is Brian Lee, and I am a junior studying Computational Modeling and Data Analytics at Virginia Tech. I have particular interests in data science, mathematical modeling and machine learning.

This repository contains various projects made from both inside and outside of the classroom. For notation, each project denoted with a "p" for personal projects, and "vt" for projects made for Virginia Tech courses. The number following the letters is the number of the project's inception. Each project folder also has its own Readme file, where I explain its purpose and facts to know about the project. Although this can be read in those Readme files, it should be noted that the code belonging to the Virginia Tech projects is omitted, so as to uphold academic integrity.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me at: leebri2n@vt.edu.
