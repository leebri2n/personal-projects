Welcome!

My name is Brian Lee, and I am a junior studying Computational Modeling and Data Analytics at Virginia Tech. I have particular interests in data science, mathematical modeling and machine learning.

This repository contains various projects made from both inside and outside of the classroom. Each project is in a subdirectory denoted as "p__" where the number following "p" is the sequential number of the projects' inceptions. Each project folder also has its own readme file, where I explain its purpose and facts to know about the project.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me at: leebri2n@vt.edu.
