given x and y, use regression to mdel a success or not
  - lgoistic regression

process
  - eda+visualization
  - model
    - can havel multiple versions of same modle

    -histogram for time
    -decison tree?

to do list
  - eda
    - work with json
      - observe significance of certain independent variables of interest\
      - coordinates: make map of circles for success, x for score
        - therefore, for example, you can model what kind of outcome
  - build models
    - measures by how much more effective is ovi near cirlce, not just
      that he is
