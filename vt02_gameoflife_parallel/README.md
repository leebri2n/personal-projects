This is a school project for CMDA3634, Computer Science Foundations for Computational Modeling and Data Analytics, submitted 8 December, 2021. Therefore, all code is omitted so as to uphold academic integrity. Only final results are shown.

In this project, I implement multiple working versions of John Conway's Game of Life simulation. The first iteration, in Python is a rapid prototype for the logic and functionality of the simulation. The second iteration, now implemented in C, is the first-pass performant solution. The third iteration, which is also in implemented in C, modifies the program to run parallel in a shared-memory environment through OpenMP on one nodes on Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Computing (ARC) cluster. Lastly, the fourth iteration, which is also implemented in C, modifies the simulation to run parallel in a distributed memory environment through the Message Passing Interface (MPI) across multiple nodes on Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Computing (ARC) cluster.
